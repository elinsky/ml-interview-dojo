# Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma

**Q:** What is the exploration-exploitation dilemma?
- Definition
- Why it's fundamental
- Examples

**A:**

- **Definition**: trade-off between:
  - **Exploitation**: use current best known action (maximize immediate reward)
  - **Exploration**: try new actions to potentially find better ones (gather information)
- **Why fundamental**:
  - Can't do both simultaneously
  - Too much exploitation: miss better options (local optimum)
  - Too much exploration: waste time on bad actions
  - Need balance to maximize long-term reward
- **Examples**:
  - Restaurant: try new places vs go to favorite
  - Ads: show proven ad vs test new creative
  - Trading: use known strategy vs try new signals
- **Key insight**: exploration has information value — learn about environment to make better future decisions
