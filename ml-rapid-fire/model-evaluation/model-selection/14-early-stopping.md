# Early Stopping as Model Selection

**Q:** Why is early stopping considered a form of model selection?

**A:**

- Number of training iterations controls model complexity
  - More iterations → model can fit more complex patterns → higher variance
- Stopping early effectively selects a simpler model
- Acts as implicit regularization without modifying the loss function
