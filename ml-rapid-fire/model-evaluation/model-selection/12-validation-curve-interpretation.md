# Validation Curve Interpretation

**Q:** On a validation curve, what indicates underfitting? What indicates overfitting?

**A:**

- Underfitting: both training and validation curves perform poorly
  - If y-axis is score: both low
  - If y-axis is error: both high
- Overfitting: training performs well, validation performs poorly (large gap)
  - If y-axis is score: training high, validation low
  - If y-axis is error: training low, validation high
