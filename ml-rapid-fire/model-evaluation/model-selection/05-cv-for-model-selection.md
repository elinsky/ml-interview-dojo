# Cross-Validation for Model Selection

**Q:** Why use cross-validation during hyperparameter tuning?

**A:**

- Get more reliable estimate of generalization
- Reduces variance from single train/val split
- Each hyperparameter setting evaluated on multiple folds
- Average performance across folds for comparison
