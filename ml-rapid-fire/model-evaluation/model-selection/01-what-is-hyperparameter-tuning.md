# What is Hyperparameter Tuning?

**Q:** What is hyperparameter tuning and why is it necessary?

**A:**

- Process of finding optimal hyperparameters for a model
- Hyperparameters are set before training, not learned
- Affects model capacity, regularization, learning dynamics
- Goal: maximize validation performance
