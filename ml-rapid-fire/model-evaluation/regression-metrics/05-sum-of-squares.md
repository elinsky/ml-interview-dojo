# Sum of Squares (SST, SSE, SSR)

**Q:** What are SST, SSE, and SSR?
- SST formula and meaning
- SSE formula and meaning
- SSR formula and meaning
- Key relationship

**A:**

- **SST** (Sum of Squares Total) = Σ(y - ȳ)²
  - Total variance in Y: "How much do actual values vary from the mean?"
- **SSE** (Sum of Squared Errors) = Σ(y - ŷ)²
  - Unexplained variance: "How much does the model get wrong?"
- **SSR** (Sum of Squares Regression) = Σ(ŷ - ȳ)²
  - Explained variance: "How much variance does the model explain?"
- **Key relationship**: SST = SSE + SSR
