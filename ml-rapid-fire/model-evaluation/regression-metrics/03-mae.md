# Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

**Q:** What is MAE and when should you use it?

**A:**

- MAE = (1/n) * Σ|y - ŷ|
- Average absolute difference between predicted and actual
- **More robust to outliers** than MSE/RMSE
- Linear penalty (treats all errors proportionally)
- Harder to optimize (not differentiable at 0)
