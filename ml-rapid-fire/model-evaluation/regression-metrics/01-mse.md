# Mean Squared Error (MSE)

**Q:** What is Mean Squared Error (MSE)?

**A:**

- MSE = (1/n) * Σ(y - ŷ)²
- Average of squared differences between predicted and actual
- Penalizes large errors more heavily (quadratic penalty)
- Units are target variable squared (less interpretable)
- MSE is a **metric**; Least Squares is a **fitting method**
