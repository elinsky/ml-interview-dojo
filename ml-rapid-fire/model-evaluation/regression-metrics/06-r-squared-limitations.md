# R² Limitations

**Q:** What are the limitations of R²?

**A:**

- **Always increases** (or stays same) when adding features
- Can be negative if model worse than predicting mean
- Doesn't indicate if model is biased
- High R² doesn't guarantee good out-of-sample predictions
- Use **Adjusted R²** to compare models with different feature counts
