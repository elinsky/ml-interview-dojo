# Precision-Recall Tradeoff

**Q:** What is the precision-recall tradeoff?

**A:**

- **Lower threshold**: more positive predictions → higher recall, lower precision
- **Raise threshold**: fewer positive predictions → higher precision, lower recall
- Can't maximize both simultaneously
- Choose based on business cost of FP vs FN
- Plot PR curve to visualize tradeoff at all thresholds
