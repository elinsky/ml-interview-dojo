# Accuracy

**Q:** What is accuracy and when does it fail?

**A:**

- Accuracy = (TP + TN) / Total
- Fails with imbalanced classes (99% accuracy predicting all majority)
- Doesn't distinguish between types of errors
- Use when classes are balanced AND both errors equally costly
- For imbalanced data: use precision, recall, F1 instead
