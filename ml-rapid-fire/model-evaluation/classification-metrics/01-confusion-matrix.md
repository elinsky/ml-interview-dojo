# Confusion Matrix

**Q:** What is a confusion matrix?

**A:**

- 2x2 table for binary classification: TP, TN, FP, FN
- Rows = actual class, columns = predicted class (convention varies)
- **TP**: predicted positive, actually positive
- **TN**: predicted negative, actually negative
- **FP**: predicted positive, actually negative (Type I error)
- **FN**: predicted negative, actually positive (Type II error)
