# Precision

**Q:** What is precision and when do you prioritize it?

**A:**

- Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
- "Of predicted positives, how many were correct?"
- Prioritize when **false positives are costly**
- E.g., spam filter (don't lose real emails to spam folder)
- E.g., recommending invasive surgery
