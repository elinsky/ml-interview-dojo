# Precision-Recall Tradeoff

**Q:** What is the precision-recall tradeoff?
- Mechanism (what causes the tradeoff)
- Why you can't have both
- How to choose
- How to visualize

**A:**

- **Lower decision threshold**: more positive predictions → higher recall, lower precision
- **Raise decision threshold**: fewer positive predictions → higher precision, lower recall
- Can't maximize both: the same lever (threshold) moves them in opposite directions
- Choose based on business cost of FP vs FN
- Plot Precision-Recall curve to visualize tradeoff at all decision thresholds
