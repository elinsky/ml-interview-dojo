# Stratified K-Fold

**Q:** What is stratified k-fold and when should you use it?

- When to use it
- Why it helps (benefit)

**A:**

- **Preserves**: class distribution in each fold (e.g., 20% cats / 80% dogs in every fold)
- **When to use**: imbalanced classification problems
- **Benefit**: reduces variance in performance estimates by ensuring representative samples
