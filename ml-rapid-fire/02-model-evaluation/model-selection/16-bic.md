# BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)

**Q:** What is BIC and how does it differ from AIC?

**A:**

- Similar to AIC: balances model fit with complexity penalty
- BIC = k*ln(n) - 2ln(L)
  - k = number of parameters
  - n = number of data points
  - L = maximum likelihood
- Penalizes complexity more heavily than AIC → favors simpler models
- Lower is better
