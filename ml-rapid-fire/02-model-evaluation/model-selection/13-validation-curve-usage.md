# Using Validation Curves

**Q:** How do you use validation curves in practice?

**A:**

- Plot a validation curve for each hyperparameter you want to tune
- Use after initial hyperparameter search to understand single-parameter effects
- Look for the "sweet spot" where validation performance is best before overfitting begins
