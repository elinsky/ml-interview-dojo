# Grid vs Random vs Bayesian Search

**Q:** When would you choose grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization?

**A:**

- Grid search: small parameter space, few hyperparameters, need exhaustive coverage
- Random search: large parameter space, limited budget, some hyperparameters matter more than others
- Bayesian optimization: expensive evaluations (large models), continuous hyperparameters, very limited budget
