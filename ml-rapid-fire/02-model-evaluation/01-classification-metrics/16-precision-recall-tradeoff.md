# Precision-Recall Tradeoff

**Q:** What is the precision-recall tradeoff?

**A:**
- Lower threshold → more positive predictions → higher recall, lower precision
- Raise threshold → fewer positive predictions → higher precision, lower recall
- Can't maximize both: the same lever (threshold) moves them in opposite directions
