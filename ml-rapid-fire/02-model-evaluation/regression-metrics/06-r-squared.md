# R-Squared (Coefficient of Determination)

**Q:** What is R² and how do you interpret it?
- Formula
- Interpretation (one sentence)
- What R²=0 means
- What R²=1 means

**A:**

- **Formula**: R² = 1 - (SSE/SST) = SSR/SST
- **Interpretation**: Proportion of variance in Y explained by the model
- **R²=0**: Model explains no variance; no better than predicting the mean
- **R²=1**: Model explains all variance; perfect predictions
