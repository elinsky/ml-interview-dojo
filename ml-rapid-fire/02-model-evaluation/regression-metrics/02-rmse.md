# Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

**Q:** What is RMSE and why use it over MSE?
- Formula
- Units advantage
- Interpretation
- Limitation it shares with MSE

**A:**

- **Formula**: RMSE = √MSE = √[(1/n) * Σ(y - ŷ)²]
- **Units advantage**: Same units as target variable (MSE has squared units)
- **Interpretation**: Quadratic mean of errors; equivalent to standard deviation of residuals when mean error ≈ 0
- **Limitation**: Still sensitive to outliers due to squaring (like MSE)
