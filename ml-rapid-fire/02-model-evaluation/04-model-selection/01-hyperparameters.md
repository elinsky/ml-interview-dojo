# Hyperparameters vs Learned Parameters

**Q:** What are hyperparameters and how do they differ from learned parameters?

**A:**
- Hyperparameters: model settings set before training, not learned from data
  - Examples: C/kernel/gamma for SVM, alpha for Lasso, tree depth
- Too expensive or impossible to learn (discrete choices, non-differentiable)
- Affect model capacity, regularization, learning dynamics
