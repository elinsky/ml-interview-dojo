# Mean Squared Error (MSE)

**Q:** What is Mean Squared Error (MSE)?
- Formula
- What it is (type of function)
- Interpretation (one sentence)
- How it handles large errors
- Difference from OLS

**A:**

- **Formula**: MSE = (1/n) * Σ(y - ŷ)²
- **What it is**: A **loss function** (aka cost function) that measures estimator quality
- **Interpretation**: Average of squared differences between predicted and actual values
- **Large errors**: Penalizes large errors more heavily due to quadratic penalty
- **Difference from OLS**: MSE is a loss function that measures quality; OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) is an estimator that minimizes MSE
