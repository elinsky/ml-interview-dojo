# Derivative Definition

**Q:** What is a derivative and what does it represent?
- Definition
- Geometric interpretation
- Notation

**A:**

- **Definition**: f'(x) = lim(h→0) [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h — instantaneous rate of change
- **Geometric interpretation**: slope of tangent line to f(x) at point x
- **Notation**: f'(x), df/dx, Df, ∂f/∂x (partial)
- **Key insight for ML**: derivative tells us how to adjust parameters to decrease loss
  - f'(x) > 0: function increasing → decrease x to decrease f
  - f'(x) < 0: function decreasing → increase x to decrease f
