# Determinant

**Q:** What is a determinant and what does it tell you?
- Geometric interpretation
- Key properties
- When det = 0
- 2×2 formula

**A:**

- **Geometric interpretation**: signed volume of parallelepiped formed by column vectors; |det| = scaling factor of linear transformation
- **Key properties**:
  - det(AB) = det(A) · det(B)
  - det(Aᵀ) = det(A)
  - det(A⁻¹) = 1/det(A)
  - det(cA) = cⁿdet(A) for n×n matrix
- **det = 0**: matrix is singular (not invertible), columns are linearly dependent
- **2×2 formula**: det([[a,b],[c,d]]) = ad - bc
