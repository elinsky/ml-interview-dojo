# Uniform Distribution

**Q:** What is the uniform distribution?
- Continuous vs discrete versions
- When it's used
- Key property

**A:**

- **Continuous**: U(a,b) — all values in [a,b] equally likely; PDF = 1/(b-a)
- **Discrete**: each of n outcomes has probability 1/n (e.g., fair die)
- **Use cases**: random number generation, modeling complete uncertainty, prior when no information available
- **Key property**: maximum entropy distribution for bounded support (least informative)
