# Type I and Type II Errors

**Q:** What are Type I and Type II errors?
- Definition of each
- Relationship to α and β
- Tradeoff between them

**A:**

- **Type I error** (false positive): reject H₀ when H₀ is actually true; probability = α (significance level)
- **Type II error** (false negative): fail to reject H₀ when H₁ is actually true; probability = β
- **Tradeoff**: decreasing α (stricter threshold) increases β, and vice versa
- **Memory trick**: Type I = false alarm (crying wolf); Type II = missed detection
- **Example**: Type I = deploying strategy that doesn't actually work; Type II = missing a profitable strategy
