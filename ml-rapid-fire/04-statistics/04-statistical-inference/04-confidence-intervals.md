# Confidence Intervals

**Q:** What is a confidence interval and how do you interpret it?
- Definition
- Correct interpretation
- Incorrect interpretation
- Relationship to hypothesis testing

**A:**

- **Definition**: range of values constructed so that (1-α)% of such intervals contain the true parameter
- **Correct interpretation**: "If we repeated this experiment many times, 95% of the computed CIs would contain the true parameter"
- **Incorrect interpretation**: "There's a 95% probability the true parameter is in this interval" (parameter is fixed, not random)
- **Connection to hypothesis testing**: if CI for difference doesn't include 0 → reject H₀ of no difference at α level
- **Width depends on**: sample size (↑n → narrower), variance (↑σ → wider), confidence level (↑confidence → wider)
