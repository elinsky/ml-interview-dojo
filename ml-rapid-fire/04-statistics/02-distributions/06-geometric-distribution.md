# Geometric Distribution

**Q:** What is the geometric distribution?
- What it models
- Parameter
- Mean formula
- Memoryless property

**A:**

- **Models**: number of trials until first success (or number of failures before first success)
- **Parameter**: Geometric(p) — p = success probability per trial
- **Mean**: E[X] = 1/p (trials until success version)
- **Memoryless**: only discrete distribution with memoryless property — P(X > m+n | X > m) = P(X > n)
- **Example**: number of trades until first winner
