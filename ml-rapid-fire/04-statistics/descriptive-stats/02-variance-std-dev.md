# Variance and Standard Deviation

**Q:** What are variance and standard deviation?
- Formulas (population vs sample)
- Why divide by n-1 for sample
- Interpretation
- Units

**A:**

- **Population variance**: σ² = (1/n) Σ(xᵢ - μ)²
- **Sample variance**: s² = (1/(n-1)) Σ(xᵢ - x̄)² — unbiased estimator
- **Why n-1**: Bessel's correction; sample mean is estimated from data, reducing degrees of freedom
- **Standard deviation**: σ or s = √variance — same units as data (variance is squared units)
- **Interpretation**: average squared deviation from mean; measures spread/dispersion
