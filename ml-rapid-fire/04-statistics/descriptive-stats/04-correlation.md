# Correlation (Pearson)

**Q:** What is Pearson correlation and what are its limitations?
- Formula
- Range and interpretation
- Key limitations

**A:**

- **Formula**: ρ = Cov(X,Y) / (σₓ · σᵧ) — standardized covariance
- **Range**: [-1, 1]; -1 = perfect negative linear, 0 = no linear, +1 = perfect positive linear
- **Limitations**:
  - Only measures *linear* relationships (could miss nonlinear)
  - Correlation ≠ causation
  - Sensitive to outliers
  - Zero correlation doesn't mean independence (only for normal distributions)
- **Finance caveat**: correlations are unstable; tend to spike toward 1 during crises
