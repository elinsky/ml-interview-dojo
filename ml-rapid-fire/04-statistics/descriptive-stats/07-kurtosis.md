# Kurtosis

**Q:** What is kurtosis and why does it matter?
- Definition
- Excess kurtosis (vs normal)
- What high kurtosis means
- Finance implications

**A:**

- **Definition**: measure of tail heaviness; fourth standardized moment
- **Excess kurtosis**: kurtosis - 3 (normal has kurtosis = 3, so excess = 0)
- **High kurtosis** (leptokurtic): heavier tails, more extreme values than normal
- **Low kurtosis** (platykurtic): lighter tails, fewer extremes
- **Finance**: asset returns typically have excess kurtosis > 0 ("fat tails"); risk models assuming normal underestimate tail events
