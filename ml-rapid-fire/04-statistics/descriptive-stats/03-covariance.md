# Covariance

**Q:** What is covariance and what does it tell you?
- Formula
- Interpretation of sign
- Limitation
- Relationship to variance

**A:**

- **Formula**: Cov(X,Y) = E[(X - μₓ)(Y - μᵧ)] = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]
- **Sign interpretation**:
  - Positive: X and Y tend to move together
  - Negative: X and Y tend to move opposite
  - Zero: no linear relationship (but could have nonlinear!)
- **Limitation**: scale-dependent; hard to interpret magnitude (use correlation instead)
- **Special case**: Cov(X,X) = Var(X)
