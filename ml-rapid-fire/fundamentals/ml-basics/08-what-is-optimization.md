# What is an Optimization Method?

**Q:** What is an optimization method in ML and give examples?

**A:** An optimization method is:
- An **algorithm**
- That finds **model parameters**
- That **minimize the loss function**

"Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that modifies model parameters in order to minimize a cost function." [@nielsen2015neural, p. 22]. Examples: **Gradient descent** (iterative), **OLS** (closed-form), **SGD** (single example per update). — 202101050843 Gradient Descent
