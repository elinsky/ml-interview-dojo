# Overfitting vs Underfitting

**Q:** What is overfitting vs underfitting?

**A:**

**Overfitting**:
- Model too **tailored to training data** (learns noise)
- **Generalizes poorly** to unseen data
- Diagnostic: low training error, high validation error

**Underfitting**:
- Model **too simple** to capture patterns
- **Fails to learn** underlying structure
- Diagnostic: high error on both training and validation

"The ideal model is one that stands right at the border between underfitting and overfitting." [@chollet2018deep, p. 111]
