# What is a Model?

**Q:** What is a model in machine learning?

**A:** A model is a mathematical function that maps inputs to outputs. "We assume that there is some relationship between Y and X, which can be written as Y = f(X) + ε. Here f is some fixed but unknown function... In essence, statistical learning refers to a set of approaches for estimating f." [@james2013introduction, p. 16-17]. Examples: linear regression, neural network, decision tree. — 202106191014 Statistical Learning
