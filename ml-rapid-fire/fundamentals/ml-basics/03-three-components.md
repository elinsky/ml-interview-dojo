# Three Components of ML Algorithms

**Q:** What are the three components that every ML algorithm has?

**A:** 1) **Representation**: How to represent knowledge (e.g., decision trees, neural networks, SVMs). 2) **Evaluation**: How to evaluate candidate hypotheses (e.g., accuracy, MSE, likelihood). 3) **Optimization**: How to search for the best hypothesis (e.g., gradient descent, convex optimization). — [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/basic-concepts-in-machine-learning/)
