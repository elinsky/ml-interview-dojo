# Causes of High Variance

**Q:** What causes high variance (overfitting)?

**A:**

- Model **too complex** (too many parameters/degrees of freedom)
- **Too many features** relative to samples
- **Too few training examples**
- Training **too long** (in neural nets)
- **Insufficient regularization**
- **Non-parametric models** (e.g., decision trees) — free to split as many times as they want
