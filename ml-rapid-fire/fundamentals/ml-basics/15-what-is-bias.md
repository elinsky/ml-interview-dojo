# What is Bias (Bias-Variance)?

**Q:** What is bias in the context of bias-variance?

**A:**
- The error from **approximating a complex real-world problem with a simpler model**
- A property of the learning method (e.g., linear regression tends to have high bias)

"Bias refers to the error that is introduced by approximating a real-life problem, which may be extremely complicated, by a much simpler model." [@james2013introduction, p. 35]
