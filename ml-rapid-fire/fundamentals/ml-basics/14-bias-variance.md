# Bias-Variance Tradeoff

**Q:** What is the bias-variance tradeoff?

**A:**

**Bias**:
- Error from **approximating a complex problem with a simpler model**
- High bias → underfitting

**Variance**:
- How much f̂ would **change with a different training dataset**
- High variance → overfitting

**Tradeoff**:
- As flexibility increases, **bias decreases but variance increases**
- Eventually variance increases exceed bias reductions → overfitting
- Goal: find the balance that minimizes total error
