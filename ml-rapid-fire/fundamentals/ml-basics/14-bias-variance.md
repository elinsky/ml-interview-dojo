# Bias-Variance Tradeoff

**Q:** What is the bias-variance tradeoff?

**A:**

**Bias**:
- Error from **approximating a real-life problem with a simpler model**
- High bias → underfitting

**Variance**:
- How much f̂ would **change with a different training dataset**
- High variance → overfitting

**Tradeoff**: Reducing one increases the other. Complex models = low bias, high variance. Simple models = high bias, low variance.
