# Parameters vs Hyperparameters

**Q:** What is the difference between parameters and hyperparameters?

**A:**

**Parameters**:
- **Learned** from data during training
- Optimized automatically by the algorithm
- Examples: weights, biases, coefficients

**Hyperparameters**:
- **Set by user** before training
- Require manual tuning
- Examples: learning rate, regularization strength, number of layers
