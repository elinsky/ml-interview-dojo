# What is a Loss Function?

**Q:** What is a loss function and what is it used for?

**A:** "A cost function measures how poorly a model does at predicting the right answer. The output of a cost function can also be thought of as a 'distance score' — a measure of the distance between the desired model output and the actual model output." [@chollet2018deep, p. 10]. Used during training to guide optimization. Examples: MSE for regression, cross-entropy for classification. — 202012261442 Cost Functions
