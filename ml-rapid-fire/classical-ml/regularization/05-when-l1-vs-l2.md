# When to Choose L1 vs L2

**Q:** When would you choose L1 vs L2 regularization?

**A:**

- **L2 is more commonly used** in practice
- **L1**: Many features irrelevant → want **feature selection/sparsity**
- **L2**: Most features useful → just **shrink weights**, keep all
- **L1**: More **interpretable** (fewer non-zero coefficients)
- **L2**: More **stable** when features are correlated
