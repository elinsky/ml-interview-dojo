# Regularization Hyperparameter (λ)

**Q:** What does the regularization hyperparameter λ control?

**A:**

- Controls **strength of penalty** (also called alpha)
- **Higher λ** → more regularization → simpler model → more bias, less variance
- **Lower λ** → less regularization → complex model → less bias, more variance
- **Too strong** → underfit; **too weak** → overfit
- Chosen via **cross-validation**
