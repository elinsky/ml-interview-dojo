# Boosting: Bias or Variance?

**Q:** Does boosting reduce bias or variance?

**A:**

- Primarily reduces **bias** (fits harder examples)
- Also reduces **variance** somewhat (averaging effect)
- Starts with **high-bias, low-variance** weak learners (stumps)
- Sequentially reduces bias by correcting errors
- Risk: can **overfit** if boosted too long → use early stopping
