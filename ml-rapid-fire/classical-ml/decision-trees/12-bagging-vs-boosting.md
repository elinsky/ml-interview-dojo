# Bagging vs Boosting

**Q:** What is the key difference between bagging and boosting?

**A:**

- **Bagging**: parallel, independent → reduces **variance**
- **Boosting**: sequential, dependent → reduces **bias**
- **Bagging**: equal weight to all models; **Boosting**: weight by accuracy
- **Bagging**: full-depth trees; **Boosting**: shallow trees (stumps)
- Both invented/developed by **Leo Breiman**
