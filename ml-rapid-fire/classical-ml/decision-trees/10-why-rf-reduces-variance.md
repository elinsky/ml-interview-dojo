# Why Random Forest Reduces Variance

**Q:** Why does Random Forest reduce variance?

**A:**

- **Averaging** predictions reduces variance (if errors uncorrelated)
- **Random feature selection** decorrelates trees → uncorrelated errors
- Key insight: ensemble works when "hypotheses are at least a little bit different"
- More **diverse trees** = more variance reduction
- Bias stays roughly same as single tree
