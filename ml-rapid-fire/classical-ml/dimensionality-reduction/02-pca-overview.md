# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

**Q:** What is PCA?

**A:**

- **Linear** dimensionality reduction technique
- Finds new axes (principal components) that maximize variance
- Projects data onto these new axes
- Components are **orthogonal** (uncorrelated) to each other
- First PC captures most variance, second captures next most, etc.
- **Unsupervised** — doesn't use labels
- Preserves **global structure** of data
- Common uses: preprocessing, visualization, noise reduction
- Assumes linear relationships in data
