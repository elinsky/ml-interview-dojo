# Coefficient Interpretation

**Q:** How do you interpret logistic regression coefficients?

**A:** Increasing feature x by 1 multiplies the odds by e^β.

"Increasing $X_1$ by one unit will increase the log odds by $\beta_1$, or equivalently, multiplies the odds by $e^{\beta_1}$" [@james2013introduction, p. 132]. — 202107200915 Logistic Regression

"You can think of logistic regression as a linear regression model in the log odds" [@harrell2015regression, p. 221]. — 202107200915 Logistic Regression
