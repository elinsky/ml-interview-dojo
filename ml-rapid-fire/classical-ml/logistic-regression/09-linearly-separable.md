# Linearly Separable

**Q:** What does it mean for data to be linearly separable?

**A:** Data is linearly separable if a single straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) can perfectly divide the classes. If classes are intermingled, no linear boundary works - you need nonlinear methods (kernels, neural networks).
