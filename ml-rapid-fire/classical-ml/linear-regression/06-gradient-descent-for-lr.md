# Gradient Descent for Linear Regression

**Q:** When would you use gradient descent instead of OLS for linear regression?

**A:** When dataset is too large to fit in memory. Gradient descent iteratively updates coefficients using learning rate, doesn't require matrix inversion. OLS is faster when data fits in memory.
