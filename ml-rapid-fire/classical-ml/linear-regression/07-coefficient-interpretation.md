# Coefficient Interpretation

**Q:** How do you interpret a coefficient in linear regression?

**A:** The coefficient represents the expected change in y for a one-unit increase in that input variable, holding all other variables constant. E.g., if B1=0.5 for height, each cm of height adds 0.5 to predicted weight.
