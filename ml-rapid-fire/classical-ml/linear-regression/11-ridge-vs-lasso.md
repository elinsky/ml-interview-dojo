# Ridge vs Lasso Regression

**Q:** What is the difference between Ridge and Lasso regularization?

**A:** Ridge (L2): adds penalty on squared coefficients (λΣβ²). Shrinks coefficients but keeps all [@james2013introduction, p. 215]. Lasso (L1): adds penalty on absolute coefficients (λΣ|β|). Can shrink coefficients to exactly zero (feature selection) [@james2013introduction, p. 219]. — 202101171731 L2 Regularization, 202101171802 L1 Regularization
