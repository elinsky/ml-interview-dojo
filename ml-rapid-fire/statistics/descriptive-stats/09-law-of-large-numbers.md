# Law of Large Numbers

**Q:** What is the Law of Large Numbers?
- Statement
- Weak vs strong LLN
- Practical implication
- Difference from CLT

**A:**

- **Statement**: sample mean → population mean as n → ∞
- **Weak LLN**: convergence in probability
- **Strong LLN**: almost sure convergence (stronger guarantee)
- **Practical implication**: with enough data, sample average approximates true expected value; justifies using sample statistics
- **vs CLT**: LLN says *where* the sample mean converges; CLT says *what distribution* it follows (normal) along the way
