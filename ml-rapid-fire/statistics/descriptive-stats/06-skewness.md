- Positive vs negative skew
- Why it matters in finance

**A:**

- **Definition**: measure of asymmetry; third standardized moment
- **Positive skew** (right-skewed): long right tail, mean > median (e.g., income distribution)
- **Negative skew** (left-skewed): long left tail, mean < median (e.g., equity returns — occasional large losses)

  - Most asset returns are negatively skewed (crash risk)
  - Option payoffs can create positive skew (limited downside, unlimited upside)
  - Investors generally dislike negative skew (prefer lottery-like positive skew)
