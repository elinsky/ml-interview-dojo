# Log-Normal Distribution

**Q:** What is the log-normal distribution and why do prices follow it?
- Definition
- Why prices (not returns)
- Key properties

**A:**

- **Definition**: X is log-normal if log(X) is normal; X = e^Y where Y ~ N(μ, σ²)
- **Why prices**: if returns are normal and compound multiplicatively, prices are log-normal; ensures prices stay positive
- **Properties**:
  - Right-skewed (long right tail)
  - Positive support only (can't go negative)
  - Geometric Brownian Motion → log-normal prices
- **Example**: stock prices, asset values, income distributions
