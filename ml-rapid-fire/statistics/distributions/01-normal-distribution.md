# Normal Distribution

**Q:** What are the key properties of the normal distribution?
- Parameters and notation
- 68-95-99.7 rule
- Why it appears so often
- Limitations/when it fails

**A:**

- **Parameters**: N(μ, σ²) — mean μ (center), variance σ² (spread)
- **68-95-99.7 rule**: ~68% within 1σ, ~95% within 2σ, ~99.7% within 3σ of mean
- **Why ubiquitous**: Central Limit Theorem — sum/average of many independent RVs → normal
- **Limitations**: thin tails underestimate extreme events; financial returns have fat tails (more crashes than normal predicts)
