# Binomial Distribution

**Q:** What is the binomial distribution and when do you use it?
- Setup/assumptions
- Parameters
- Mean and variance formulas
- Example use case

**A:**

- **Setup**: n independent trials, each with success probability p
- **Parameters**: Binomial(n, p) — n = number of trials, p = success probability
- **Mean**: E[X] = np
- **Variance**: Var(X) = np(1-p)
- **Example**: number of trades that are profitable out of n trades (if each has fixed win rate p)
