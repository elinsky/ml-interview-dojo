# Heavy-Tailed Distributions

**Q:** What are heavy-tailed distributions and why do they matter in finance?
- Definition (vs normal)
- Examples
- Practical implications
- How to detect

**A:**

- **Definition**: tails decay slower than exponential; extreme events more likely than normal predicts
- **Examples**: t-distribution (low df), Pareto, stable distributions, empirical return distributions
- **Finance implications**:
  - VaR/risk models using normal underestimate tail risk
  - "6 sigma" events happen far more often than normal predicts
  - Black Swan events (2008, COVID crash)
- **Detection**: kurtosis > 3 (excess kurtosis > 0), QQ-plot deviates from normal line in tails
