# Hypothesis Testing Framework

**Q:** What is hypothesis testing?
- Null and alternative hypothesis
- Decision framework
- What you can and cannot conclude

**A:**

- **Null hypothesis (H₀)**: default assumption, typically "no effect" or "no difference"
- **Alternative hypothesis (H₁)**: what you're trying to show evidence for
- **Framework**: assume H₀ true → compute probability of observed data → if very unlikely (p < α), reject H₀
- **Can conclude**: evidence against H₀ (reject) or insufficient evidence (fail to reject)
- **Cannot conclude**: "H₀ is true" — absence of evidence ≠ evidence of absence
