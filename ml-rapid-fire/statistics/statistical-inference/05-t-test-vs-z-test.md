# T-Test vs Z-Test

**Q:** When do you use a t-test vs a z-test?
- Key difference
- When to use each
- Why t-distribution

**A:**

- **Key difference**: z-test assumes population σ known; t-test estimates σ from sample
- **Use z-test**: large sample (n > 30) OR population σ known (rare in practice)
- **Use t-test**: small sample with unknown σ (most real situations)
- **Why t-distribution**: accounts for extra uncertainty from estimating σ; has heavier tails than normal; approaches normal as df → ∞
- **Degrees of freedom**: df = n - 1 for one-sample t-test
