# Statistical Power

**Q:** What is statistical power and what affects it?
- Definition
- Formula
- Factors that increase power

**A:**

- **Definition**: probability of correctly rejecting H₀ when H₁ is true = P(reject H₀ | H₁ true)
- **Formula**: Power = 1 - β (where β = Type II error rate)
- **Factors that increase power**:
  - Larger sample size (most controllable)
  - Larger effect size (bigger true difference)
  - Higher α (but increases Type I error)
  - Lower variance
- **Typical target**: 80% power is common convention
- **Power analysis**: used to determine required sample size before experiment
