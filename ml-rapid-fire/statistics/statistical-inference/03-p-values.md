# P-Values

**Q:** What is a p-value and what are common misconceptions?
- Definition
- How to interpret
- Common misconceptions

**A:**

- **Definition**: probability of observing data at least as extreme as what was observed, *assuming H₀ is true*
- **Interpretation**: small p-value = data is unlikely under H₀ = evidence against H₀
- **Common misconceptions**:
  - p-value is NOT P(H₀ is true)
  - p-value is NOT probability the result is due to chance
  - p < 0.05 does NOT mean the effect is large or important
  - Statistical significance ≠ practical significance
- **What p-value actually is**: a measure of compatibility between data and H₀
