# What is a CNN?

**Q:** What is a Convolutional Neural Network?

**A:**

- Neural network designed for **grid-like data** (images, sequences)
- Uses **convolution** instead of matrix multiplication in some layers
- Key insight: **local connectivity** and **weight sharing**
- Dramatically fewer parameters than fully connected networks
- Achieves **translation invariance** (detect features anywhere in image)
