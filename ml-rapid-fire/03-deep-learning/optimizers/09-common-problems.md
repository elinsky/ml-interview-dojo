# Common Optimizer Problems

**Q:** What are common problems with optimizers?

**A:**

- **Saddle points**: flat regions where gradients = 0 (momentum helps)
- **Sharp minima**: generalize poorly (flat minima preferred)
- **Adaptive LR overfitting**: Adam can overfit; SGD may generalize better
- **Gradient explosion**: use gradient clipping
