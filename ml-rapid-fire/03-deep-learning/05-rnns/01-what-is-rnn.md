# What is an RNN?

**Q:** What is a Recurrent Neural Network?

**A:**

- Neural network designed for **sequential data**
- Has **hidden state** that persists across time steps
- Same weights applied at each step (weight sharing)
- Output depends on current input AND previous hidden state
- Three weight matrices: input-to-hidden, hidden-to-hidden, hidden-to-output
