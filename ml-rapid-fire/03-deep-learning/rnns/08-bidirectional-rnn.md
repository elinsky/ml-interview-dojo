# Bidirectional RNNs

**Q:** What is a bidirectional RNN?

**A:**

- Processes sequence in **both directions** (forward + backward)
- Captures context from past AND future
- Concatenate hidden states from both directions
- Limitation: can't run continuously (needs fixed endpoints)
- Not for online/streaming (can't see future in real-time)
