# Ensemble Methods

**Q:** What are the three main ensemble methods?

**A:**

- **Bagging**: parallel models on bootstrap samples, reduces variance
- **Boosting**: sequential models correcting errors, reduces bias
- **Stacking**: different model types + meta-learner (blender) to combine predictions
- Key: want errors to be **uncorrelated** across models
