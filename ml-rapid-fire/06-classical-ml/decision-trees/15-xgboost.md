# XGBoost

**Q:** What is XGBoost and why is it popular?

**A:**

- **Extreme Gradient Boosting** — optimized gradient boosting
- **Scalability** is key — scales to billions of examples
- **Regularization** built-in (L1, L2 on weights)
- **Parallelized** split-finding, handles sparse data efficiently
- Handles **missing values** automatically
- Shallow learning → **feature engineering** still important
