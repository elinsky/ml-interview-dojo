# What is Clustering?

**Q:** What is clustering?

**A:**

- **Unsupervised learning** task — no labels
- Also serves as **descriptive data analysis** for uncovering hidden patterns
- Goal: group similar data points together
- Points in same cluster are more similar to each other than to points in other clusters
- **Intra-cluster similarity** should be high, **inter-cluster similarity** should be low
- Applications: customer segmentation, image recognition, bioinformatics, anomaly detection
- Major types: partitioning (k-means), density-based (DBSCAN), hierarchical
- For high-dimensional data: consider **PCA** first to reduce noise and improve accuracy
