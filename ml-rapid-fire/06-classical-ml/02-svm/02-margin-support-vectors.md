# Margin and Support Vectors

**Q:** What is the margin and what are support vectors?

**A:**

- **Margin** = distance from decision boundary to nearest training points
- **Support vectors** = training points that lie on the margin boundary
- Only support vectors determine the hyperplane — other points don't matter
- Wider margin → better generalization
- SVM maximizes this margin
