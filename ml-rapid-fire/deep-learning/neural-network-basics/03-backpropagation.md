# Backpropagation

**Q:** How does backpropagation work?

**A:**

- Compute **loss** between prediction and target
- Calculate gradients using **chain rule** (backward through layers)
- Each weight gets gradient: dLoss/dw
- Gradients flow from output → input layer
- Foundation of neural network training
