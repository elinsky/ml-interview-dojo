# Training Loop

**Q:** What are epochs, batches, and iterations?

**A:**

- **Epoch**: one complete pass through entire training set
- **Batch**: subset of training data processed together
- **Iteration**: one weight update (one batch processed)
- **Mini-batch gradient descent**: balance between speed and stability
- Iterations per epoch = dataset size / batch size
