# What is a Neural Network?

**Q:** What is a neural network?

**A:**

- Computational model inspired by biological neurons
- Layers of **nodes** connected by **weighted edges**
- Three layer types: **input**, **hidden**, **output**
- Each node computes: weighted sum → activation function → output
- "Deep" = multiple hidden layers
