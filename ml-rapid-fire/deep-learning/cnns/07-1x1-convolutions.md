# 1x1 Convolutions

**Q:** What are 1x1 convolutions used for?

**A:**

- **Dimensionality reduction**: reduce number of channels
- Also called **channel pooling** (height/width unchanged)
- Add nonlinearity without changing spatial dimensions
- Used heavily in Inception and ResNet architectures
- Reduces computation before expensive 3x3 or 5x5 convs
