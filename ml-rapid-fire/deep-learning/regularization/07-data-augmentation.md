# Data Augmentation

**Q:** How does data augmentation regularize?

**A:**

- Artificially increases training set size
- Images: rotation, flip, crop, color jitter, zoom, shear
- Reduces overfitting by exposing model to variations
- **Only augment training data, NOT validation**
- Especially important when data is limited
