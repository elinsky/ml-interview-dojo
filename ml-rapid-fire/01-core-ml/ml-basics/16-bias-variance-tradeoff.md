# Bias-Variance Tradeoff

**Q:** What is the bias-variance tradeoff?

**A:**
- As model flexibility increases, **bias decreases but variance increases**
- Goal: find the balance that minimizes total test error
- Initially, bias decreases faster than variance increases → test error drops
- Eventually, variance increases dominate → test error rises (overfitting)
