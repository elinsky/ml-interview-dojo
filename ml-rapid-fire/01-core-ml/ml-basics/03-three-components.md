# Three Components of ML Algorithms

**Q:** What are the three components that every ML algorithm has?

**A:**
- **Representation**: How to represent knowledge (e.g., decision trees, neural networks, SVMs)
- **Evaluation**: How to evaluate candidate hypotheses (e.g., accuracy, MSE, likelihood)
- **Optimization**: How to search for the best hypothesis (e.g., gradient descent, convex optimization)
