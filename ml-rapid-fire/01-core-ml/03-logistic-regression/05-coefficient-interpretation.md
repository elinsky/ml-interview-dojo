# Coefficient Interpretation

**Q:** How do you interpret logistic regression coefficients?

**A:**
- Increasing feature x by 1 **multiplies the odds by e^β**
- Equivalently, increasing x by 1 **increases the log odds by β**

"You can think of logistic regression as a linear regression model in the log odds" [@harrell2015regression, p. 221]
