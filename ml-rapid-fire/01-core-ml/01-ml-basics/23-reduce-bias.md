# How to Reduce Bias

**Q:** How do you reduce bias (fix underfitting)?

**A:**

- **More complex model** (more parameters, flexible functional form)
- **Add features** / feature engineering
- **Reduce regularization**
- **Boosting** — ensemble that focuses on prior errors
- **Train longer** (if stopped too early)
