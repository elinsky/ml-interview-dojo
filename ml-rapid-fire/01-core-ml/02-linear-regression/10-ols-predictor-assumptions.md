# OLS Predictor Assumptions

**Q:** What are the OLS assumptions about predictors?

**A:**
- No multicollinearity (predictors not highly correlated)
- Predictors treated as fixed (non-random) — In OLS theory, we imagine repeating the experiment with the same X values; only the unexplained noise in Y changes.
- Measured without error (rarely satisfied, usually fine)
