# UCB (Upper Confidence Bound)

**Q:** How does UCB handle exploration-exploitation?
- Key idea
- Formula
- Why it works

**A:**

- **Key idea**: "optimism in the face of uncertainty"
  - Choose action with highest upper confidence bound on value
  - Actions tried less have higher uncertainty → higher UCB → more likely selected
- **UCB1 formula**:
  - UCB(a) = Q̂(a) + c√(ln t / N(a))
  - Q̂(a): estimated value of action a
  - N(a): times action a was taken
  - t: total time steps
  - c: exploration coefficient
- **Why it works**:
  - Second term (bonus) shrinks as N(a) increases
  - Arms with few pulls have high bonus → will be tried
  - Eventually all arms tried enough, best arm dominates
- **Regret**: O(log T) — optimal order for bandits
- **Key insight**: exploration driven by uncertainty, not random chance
