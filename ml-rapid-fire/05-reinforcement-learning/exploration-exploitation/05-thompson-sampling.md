# Thompson Sampling

**Q:** How does Thompson sampling work?
- Algorithm
- Bayesian approach
- Advantages

**A:**

- **Algorithm**:
  1. Maintain posterior distribution for each arm's mean reward
  2. Sample from each posterior
  3. Play arm with highest sample
  4. Update posterior with observed reward
- **Bayesian approach**:
  - Prior beliefs about arm means
  - Update beliefs using Bayes' rule as data collected
  - For Bernoulli rewards: Beta prior → Beta posterior (conjugate)
- **Advantages**:
  - Principled probability matching: explores proportional to probability of being best
  - Often outperforms UCB empirically
  - Natural uncertainty quantification
  - Adapts exploration to actual uncertainty
- **Intuition**: uncertain arms sometimes sample high → get tried; certain arms sample near true mean
- **Finance**: portfolio allocation with uncertain returns
